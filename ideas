- use css @media in order to distinguish between mobile and desktop

- next task is to build the create resource workflow
  - including smart contracts
  - but still no style ;) 
  - image upload 
    - small express server
      - hashes the image to get the filename
      - crops the image to 1024x1024 (max) .jpg, 80%
      - crops that one to 128x128 and responds with it (preview) 
    - after selecting an image, immediately start uploading 

- alright, which page makes sense for a start? 
  - the one someone spends most time on. 
  - for a start - people want to be able to see what's there
    - it makes sense to quickly explain 
      - you can share resources here
      - you can book resources there
      - you can manage your resources here
      - you can manage your bookings here
